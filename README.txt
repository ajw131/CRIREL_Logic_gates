The Code is a bit disorganized. Feel free to reach out to Alex White at alexjwhite131@gmail.com for help running code

LIF logic will have the code for generating LIF CRIREL logic gates.
IZH logic will have the code for generating IZH CRIREL logic gates.
Adder is the code for generating the full adder in fig 8.
Motion detection is the code for generating the motion detection in fig 9.
ReLU_sigmoid is the code for generating logic gates in firing rate models shown in fig 10.

CRIREL other is assorted code that was used to generate some of the single trace plots used in the paper.
